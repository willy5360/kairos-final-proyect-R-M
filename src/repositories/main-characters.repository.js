            "In the first season, Morty is 14 years old and is a student at Harry Herpson High School along with his older sister Summer. Morty seems to be suffering from anxiety and is easily stressed, largely as a result of traumatic experiences during his adventures with Rick. He is often dismissed as idiotic by Rick and others, but is shown to be wiser than his grandfather in terms of understanding people's feelings, and is capable of explosive anger and moral outrage in objection to Rick's attitude and actions.",

She occasionally expresses jealousy that Morty gets to accompany Rick on his inter-dimensional adventures, whom she sees as a hero, though he is often contemptuous and dismissive of her teenaged life perspective and values. As the series progresses, Summer begins accompanying Rick and Morty on their adventures and is trusted with restoring their memories in the scenario of the pair being rendered amnesiac.",
